# DataTools
## Version 5.0

DataTools Memory, Hardware, and misc. Libraries v5.0

Completely refactored into C# and .NET 5.0.

Introducing a portable version of DataTools core library (not complete.)

This entire solution is a large, slow, work in progress that has taken years. 

This package is a new project, completely separate from the Visual Basic projects, and are only similar on the surface.  Most of the changes are breaking.  

More documentation will be forthcoming in the next few weeks (as of 11/28/2020), as I get the internal documentation organized.
